# Roguelike `Encounters.json` Reference

The roguelike's combat opponents are a **curated pool** defined in
**`DataLE/Roguelike/Encounters.json`**. Each combat node (`duel`, `elite`, `boss`) draws its enemy
from this pool instead of picking a random deck. An encounter names the deck to fight, plus optional
**gating** (which act / floor / ascension it may appear at) and **overrides** (enemy LP, reward, who
goes first).

**Strict mode:** this file is **required**. If a combat node finds no eligible encounter, it logs an
error and **does not start a duel** (no random fallback). Author enough encounters to cover every
combat node your map can produce.

**When changes apply:** the file is read once and cached, so **restart the server** after editing.
Changes affect **new picks** only (an in-progress duel keeps the enemy it was built with).

**Decks live in `DataLE/Roguelike/Opponents/`** (`.json` or `.ydk`). `Encounters.json` references
them by filename via the `deck` field — that folder is the deck store; this file is the curation
layer on top of it.

## Structure

A JSON object **keyed by node type**. Each value is an array of encounter objects. The type is
implied by the key, so entries have no `type` field.

```json
{
  "duel":  [ { ...encounter... }, { ...encounter... } ],
  "elite": [ { ...encounter... } ],
  "boss":  [ { ...encounter... } ]
}
```

Only `duel`, `elite`, and `boss` are combat today. `event` / `shop` / `reward` keys are allowed and
parsed but inert until those node actions exist.

---

## Fields

| Field | Required | Default / fallback | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | yes | — | Unique across the whole file. |
| `name` | no | the `deck` filename (no extension) | Shown on the boss node and as the opponent's name. |
| `text` | no | `""` | Flavor; reserved for future `event` nodes. |
| `deck` | yes | — | File in `Roguelike/Opponents/` (`.json`/`.ydk`). An extension is recommended. |
| `act` | no | always eligible | `{ "min": x, "max": y }`, inclusive, 0-based act. |
| `floor` | no | always eligible | `{ "min": x, "max": y }`, inclusive; floor = the node's row. |
| `ascension` | no | always eligible | `{ "min": x, "max": y }`, inclusive. |
| `weight` | no | `1.0` | Relative weight when several encounters are eligible (all-equal = uniform). |
| `enemyLp` | no | `Settings.enemyLp[type]` (scaled) | Override the enemy's starting LP. |
| `reward` | no | `RewardFor(type)` (boss 1000 / elite 250 / duel 100) | Override run currency on win. |
| `firstPlayer` | no | random (seeded) | `0` = you go first, `1` = the enemy goes first. |
| `cpuRate` | no | `Settings.cpuRate` (100) | CPU AI strength −100…100 (100 = max). |
| `cpuFlag` | no | `Settings.cpuFlag` (None) | AI behavior: `None`/`Def`/`Fool`/`Light`/`MyTurnOnly`/`AttackOnly`/`Simple`. |
| `modifiers` | no | none | Scripted starting board + LP/hand deltas — see [Modifiers](#modifiers-starting-board). |
| `action` | no | type default (if any) | Action tree fired after the encounter resolves. Object (inline), string (ref into [`Actions.json`](#actionsjson-and-type-defaults)), `null` (no action — overrides the type default), or absent (use type default). Combat encounters fire it on win; non-combat (`event`) on arrival. See [Actions](#actions-options--message--openpack). |

In each range block (`act` / `floor` / `ascension`) either `min` or `max` may be omitted for an
open-ended bound. An omitted block means "no restriction on that axis".

## How an enemy is chosen

- **`duel` / `elite` — chosen on arrival.** When you step onto the node, the server lists every
  encounter of that type whose ranges contain the current act, the node's floor, and your ascension,
  then picks one at random by `weight`. The pick is deterministic (seeded by the run + node), so an
  unfinished duel **resumes with the same enemy and the same draws** — you can't quit to re-roll.
- **`boss` — chosen when the map is generated.** Each act's boss is picked the moment the act's map
  is built and baked into the boss node, so the **map shows the boss's `name` before you fight it**.

---

## Gating (act / floor / ascension)

Ranges restrict where an encounter may appear. All present ranges must contain the value for the
encounter to be eligible.

```json
{ "id": "act1_only",   "deck": "X.json", "act":   { "min": 0, "max": 0 } }
{ "id": "deep_floors", "deck": "Y.json", "floor": { "min": 4 } }
{ "id": "high_asc",    "deck": "Z.json", "ascension": { "min": 3 } }
```

- `act` 0 = the first act. The boss lives on the top row of each act, so gate bosses by **act**, not
  floor.
- `floor` is the node's row (0 = entry row). A `duel`/`elite` with `floor:{min:4}` only appears from
  row 4 up.
- `ascension` lets you reserve nastier decks for higher difficulty tiers.

---

## Overrides (LP, reward, first player)

Any encounter can override the per-type defaults:

```json
{ "id": "boss_exodia", "name": "The Forbidden One", "deck": "Exodia.json",
  "act": { "min": 2 }, "enemyLp": 13000, "reward": 4000 }
```

- `enemyLp` — absolute LP for this enemy. **Note:** an explicit value bypasses the per-act /
  ascension scaling that `Settings.json` applies to the type default. Omit it to keep that scaling.
- `reward` — flat run currency credited on win, replacing the type's default reward.
- `firstPlayer` — force the turn order (`0` you, `1` enemy). Omit for a seeded coin flip.
- `cpuRate` / `cpuFlag` — tune the opponent's AI. `cpuRate` is its strength (−100…100, default 100 =
  full); `cpuFlag` picks a behavior mode — `Fool` (plays badly), `Light` (weaker logic), `MyTurnOnly`
  (won't respond on your turn), `AttackOnly`, `Simple`, `Def` (defensive), or `None` (default full
  AI). Handy for making early/low-tier duels easier without changing the deck.

---

## Modifiers (starting board)

`modifiers` scripts the **opening board** of a duel — cards already on the field / in hand for each
side — plus small **LP/hand deltas**. Two sides: **`player`** (you) and **`enemy`** (this opponent).

```json
"modifiers": {
  "enemy": {
    "fieldSpell": { "cid": 30241314 },
    "monsters":   [ { "cid": 5381, "pos": "atk" }, null, { "cid": 22222, "pos": "def" } ],
    "spellTraps": [ { "cid": 44095762, "pos": "set" } ],
    "hand":       [ { "cid": 55144522 } ],
    "extraLp":    2000,
    "extraHand":  1
  },
  "player": { "extraHand": -1 }
}
```

- **`fieldSpell`** — one card, placed face-up active.
- **`monsters`** — slots 0–4 (M1–M5); `null` skips a slot. `pos`: `atk` / `def` / `set` (face-down
  defense) / `facedown` / `atk_fd` / `def_fd` (default `atk`).
- **`spellTraps`** — slots 0–4 (S1–S5). `pos`: `set` (face-down, default) / `face_up`.
- **`hand`** — extra cards placed in hand.
- **`extraLp`** / **`extraHand`** — additive deltas (may be negative). They **sum across layers** and
  apply on top of the base LP (`enemyLp` / your run LP) and base hand (5 Normal / 4 Rush) — they do
  not replace those. There is no separate hand-size key; use `extraHand`.

`cid` is the card's internal id — the same numbers used in deck `ids`. Cards past the 5 slots are
ignored; an unknown `cid` is silently skipped by the engine.

Modifiers merge with per-type defaults from `Settings.json` (`modifierDefaults`): **defaults first,
then the encounter on top** — cards merge by slot, `extraLp`/`extraHand` sum.

**Random cards.** Instead of `{ "cid": N }`, a card can be drawn at random from a deck or the card
pool — picked server-side and seeded, so a resumed duel reproduces it:

```json
{ "random": "monster", "subtype": "effect", "minAtk": 2000, "source": "deck", "deck_owner": "own" }
```

- `random` — `monster` / `main_monster` / `extra_monster` / `spell` / `trap` / `field_spell` /
  `spell_or_trap` (omit or `any` = no kind filter).
- `subtype` — monster: `normal` / `effect` / `ritual` / `fusion` / `synchro` / `xyz` / `link`;
  spell/trap: `normal` / `counter` / `field` / `equip` / `continuous` / `quickplay` / `ritual`.
- `minAtk` / `maxAtk` / `minDef` / `maxDef` / `minLevel` / `maxLevel` — numeric filters (monsters).
- `rarity` / `rarities` — hard filter by `CardList.json` rarity. `rarity: "UR"` or
  `rarities: ["SR","UR"]` (values: `N` / `R` / `SR` / `UR`). Applies to `any` / `link` /
  `deck` sources. Cards missing a rarity entry are excluded when the filter is set.
- `source` — `deck` (default) draws from a deck via `deck_owner` (`own` (default) / `rival` / `p1` /
  `p2`); `any` draws from the configurable card pool (below); `link` draws from cards **related**
  (`CARD_Link`) to the `deck_owner` deck's cards, kept only if also in the pool. Duplicate picks on a
  side are avoided; an empty pool drops that card.

**`source: "any"` pool** — `DataLE/Roguelike/CardPool.json` defines the pool `any` draws from (and
that card rewards will reuse):

```json
{
  "regulation": "Goat Format",
  "include": [12345],
  "exclude": [67890],
  "rarityRates": { "N": 8, "R": 4, "SR": 2, "UR": 1 },
  "rateGroups": [ { "cids": [5381, 5655], "rate": 5 }, { "cids": [9999], "rate": 0 } ],
  "pity": {
    "UR": { "increment": 10, "max": 50, "reset_on": ["UR"] },
    "SR": { "increment": 5,  "max": 30, "reset_on": ["SR", "UR"] }
  },
  "byAscension": [ {}, { "include": [99999], "rarityRates": { "UR": 3 } } ]
}
```

- **Membership** — base = `CardList.json` minus the configured (or server-default) regulation's
  banlist; then global `include`/`exclude`, then `byAscension[asc]` (exact ascension index).
- **Weighting** — `any` / `link` picks are weighted (not uniform). A card's weight =
  `rarityRates[rarity]` × the product of `rateGroups` rates it belongs to (default 1). `rarityRates`
  keys are `N` / `R` / `SR` / `UR` (or `1`–`4`, from `CardList.json`); a group `rate` of `0` makes
  its cards never appear. `byAscension[asc].rarityRates` override the global per rarity; its
  `rateGroups` stack with the global ones.
- `source: "deck"` picks stay uniform. Missing file = the default regulation's pool, uniform.
  Cached — restart the server to apply.
- **Pity** — only used by `openpack` actions (below). Per-rarity counter on the run that grows
  every pack which didn't yield a card of that rarity, adding a bonus to that rarity's weight
  on the next pack until the counter resets. `increment` = bonus added per missed pack,
  `max` = clamp on the accumulated bonus, `reset_on` = rarities that, when drawn, zero the
  counter (default `[r]`). `byAscension[asc].pity` merges per-rarity per-field with the global.

---

## Actions (`options` / `message` / `openpack`)

An encounter's `action` is a tree of action nodes the server walks after the encounter resolves
(on win for combat, on arrival for `event`). The client renders prompts; the server applies state.

### Action kinds

| `type` | What it does |
|---|---|
| `options` | Branch — show a list of labeled choices; player picks one and the engine descends into that option's `next`. |
| `message` | Show text with a single OK; advances to `next` (or completes when `next` is null/missing). |
| `openpack` | Open one or more packs of cards with weighted draws and pity, then either keep all or pick X of N. Adds the resolved cards to the run's pool / deck, then advances to `next`. |

```json
"action": {
  "type": "options",
  "text": "Um viajante oferece uma escolha…",
  "options": [
    { "label": "Abrir o baú", "next": { "type": "message", "text": "Você pegou uma carta." } },
    { "label": "Seguir",      "next": null }
  ]
}
```

**Continuations use `next`.** Inside an action tree, every node may have a `next` field that
points to the action that follows: `option.next` (per branch under `options`), `openpack.next`
(after the pack is finalized), and `message.next` (after the OK is acknowledged). The top-level
field on an encounter is `action` (the entry point); everything inside is chained with `next`.
An option whose `next` is `null` or missing ends the tree.

### `openpack`

```jsonc
{
  "type": "openpack",
  "packs": 3,                 // how many packs to open in sequence (default 1)
  "pick": 0,                  // 0 = keep all; >0 = player picks exactly X out of all cards shown
  "pulls": [
    { "count": 6, "pool": { "source": "any", "random": "monster" } },
    { "count": 1, "pool": { "source": "any", "random": "spell"   } },
    { "count": 1, "chance": 0.5,
      "pool": { "source": "any", "random": "monster", "rarity": "UR" } }
  ],

  // Optional pity override merged per-rarity with CardPool.json's global+ascension pity.
  // Set "pity": false to disable pity entirely for this action.
  "pity": { "UR": { "increment": 20 } },

  // Optional UI labels (Brazilian Portuguese defaults via RoguelikeLabels).
  // {0} = pick count, {1} = total shown.
  "title_keep":    "Cartas obtidas",
  "title_pick":    "Selecione {0} de {1} cartas",
  "confirm_label": "Confirmar",

  // Next action after the player confirms; same shape as `option.next`. Null/missing ends the tree.
  "next": null
}
```

- **`pulls`** — ordered list of draws **per pack**. Pack size = `sum(pulls[].count)`. Each of the
  `packs` packs rolls the pulls independently. `chance` (default 1.0) is a per-pull probability;
  a failed pull is skipped (that pack ends up with fewer cards). Each pull's `pool` is a random
  spec (same fields as the modifiers' [random spec](#modifiers-starting-board)), so `source`,
  `random`, `subtype`, numeric filters, and the new `rarity` / `rarities` filter all work.
- **`pick` vs total** — `pick` is over the **total** shown in the result UI. With `packs: 3` and
  `sum(pulls.count) = 8`, the result shows 24 cards; `pick: 5` makes the player choose 5.
- **Pity** — every pack ticks the run's per-rarity pity counter (no card of rarity `r` → `pity[r]++`;
  any card whose rarity is in `reset_on[r]` → `pity[r] = 0`). The bonus
  `min(pity[r] * increment, max)` is added to `rarityRates[r]` on the next pack. Merge order:
  global `CardPool.json` → `byAscension[asc]` → `action.pity` (per-rarity, per-field). `pity: false`
  on the action turns it off for that action (no bonus, no ticking).
- **Determinism** — all draws are seeded by the run + node + pack index. A resumed pack picks the
  same cards. Re-rolling requires advancing the run.
- **State** — cards are added to the run's pool (and to the deck in keep-all mode) when the player
  confirms. The action then advances to `next`.

---

## `Actions.json` and type defaults

Two ways to keep `Encounters.json` clean when many encounters share the same action tree:

### Named action registry (`Actions.json`)

Optional file at `DataLE/Roguelike/Actions.json` — a flat map of `name → action tree`.
Anywhere an `action` (or `option.action`, or `openpack.next`) value is expected, a **string**
may be used instead of the inline object — the loader looks it up by name.

```json
// Actions.json
{
  "smallReward": {
    "type": "openpack",
    "packs": 1,
    "pulls": [ { "count": 3, "pool": { "source": "any", "random": "monster" } } ]
  },
  "bigBossReward": {
    "type": "openpack",
    "packs": 1,
    "pick": 1,
    "pulls": [ { "count": 5, "pool": { "source": "any", "rarity": "UR" } } ]
  },
  "treasureChest": {
    "type": "options",
    "text": "Um baú trancado…",
    "options": [
      { "label": "Abrir", "next": "smallReward" },
      { "label": "Seguir", "next": null }
    ]
  }
}
```

Then in `Encounters.json`:

```json
{ "id": "duel_basic", "deck": "Beatdown.json", "action": "smallReward" }
{ "id": "boss_a3",    "deck": "Exodia.json",    "action": "bigBossReward" }
```

- **Resolution is at load time.** The library is read once; each string ref is replaced with the
  actual tree before validation. Restart the server to apply file changes (same as `Encounters.json`
  / `CardPool.json`).
- **Shared by reference.** N encounters using the same name share the same tree object — the
  engine only reads, never mutates.
- **Strict refs.** A string that doesn't exist in `Actions.json` fails the encounter's load
  (logged and skipped). Same goes for cycles (`A → next: B → next: A`).
- **Nested refs.** Inside an action tree, every `next` (under `options[i]`, `openpack`, or
  `message`) may also be a string; they're resolved recursively. `null` and missing keys both end
  that branch.
- **Optional file.** No `Actions.json` = only inline trees and `null` work — nothing else changes.

### Type defaults (`defaultAction`)

A top-level `defaultAction` block in `Encounters.json` assigns a default action **per node type**.
Encounters of that type without an `action` key inherit the default; an explicit `null` opts out.

```json
{
  "defaultAction": {
    "duel":  "smallReward",
    "elite": "smallReward",
    "boss":  "bigBossReward"
  },
  "duel":  [
    { "id": "duel_basic",   "deck": "Beatdown.json" },                          // gets smallReward
    { "id": "duel_no_loot", "deck": "Final Countdown.json", "action": null }    // no action (opt out)
  ],
  "boss":  [
    { "id": "boss_a3", "deck": "Exodia.json", "act": { "min": 2 },
      "action": { "type": "message", "text": "…" } }                            // overrides default with inline
  ]
}
```

Each default value follows the same rules as an encounter's `action`: string ref into
`Actions.json`, inline object, or `null`. **Absent** on an encounter means "use default";
**null** on an encounter means "no action even if there's a default".

---

## Defaults & relationship to `Settings.json`

`Encounters.json` decides **which deck** you fight; `Settings.json` still provides the **defaults**
for anything an encounter doesn't override:

- enemy LP → `Settings.enemyLp[type]` (with `perAct` / `perAscension` / `ascensionScale` applied),
- reward → the built-in per-type amount,
- turn order → a seeded coin flip,
- CPU AI → `Settings.cpuRate` (100 = max) and `Settings.cpuFlag` (None = full default AI).

So the simplest encounter — just `id` + `deck` (+ optional `name`) — inherits the difficulty curve
you already tuned in `Settings.json`. Reach for overrides only when a specific enemy needs to break
from the curve.

---

## Strict coverage — avoiding soft-locks

Because there is no random fallback, **every combat node your map can generate must have at least one
eligible encounter**. Practical rules:

- Provide several **ungated** `duel` encounters — they cover every floor of every act (floor 0 is
  always a duel).
- Provide `elite` encounters that cover wherever elites can spawn (see `Settings.typeRules.elite`).
- Provide a `boss` for **every act index** `0 .. acts-1`. A boss with an open-ended `act` (e.g.
  `{ "min": 2 }`) conveniently covers that act and all later ones.

If a node finds nothing eligible, the server logs e.g.
`[Roguelike] no encounter for type elite act 1 floor 5 asc 0` (or `no boss encounter for act N`),
and the node won't start a duel. Watch the server console the first time you run a new pool.

---

## Full example

```json
{
  "duel": [
    { "id": "duel_beatdown", "deck": "Beatdown.json" },
    { "id": "duel_warrior",  "deck": "Warrior.json" },
    { "id": "duel_zombie",   "deck": "Zombie.json" },
    { "id": "duel_stall",    "name": "Stall Tactician", "deck": "Final Countdown.json",
      "floor": { "min": 4 }, "firstPlayer": 1 }
  ],

  "elite": [
    { "id": "elite_goat_control", "name": "Goat Master", "deck": "Goat Control.json", "enemyLp": 5000 },
    { "id": "elite_monarch",      "deck": "Monarch.json" },
    { "id": "elite_chaos_turbo",  "deck": "Chaos Turbo.json" }
  ],

  "boss": [
    { "id": "boss_a1_chaos",  "name": "Lord of Chaos",  "deck": "Chaos Control.json",       "act": { "max": 0 } },
    { "id": "boss_a2_ritual", "name": "The Ritual Lord", "deck": "Relinquished Control.json", "act": { "min": 1, "max": 1 } },
    { "id": "boss_a3_exodia", "name": "The Forbidden One", "deck": "Exodia.json",
      "act": { "min": 2 }, "enemyLp": 13000, "reward": 4000 }
  ]
}
```

This pool: three ungated duels (cover every floor) plus a deep-floor stall that goes first; three
elites (one tankier); and one boss per act, with the act-3 boss tankier and worth more — every other
LP/reward value comes from `Settings.json`.
